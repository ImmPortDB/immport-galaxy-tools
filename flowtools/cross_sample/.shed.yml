description: runs CrossSample using the MFI from FLOCK and text-converted FCS files
long_description: |
    **Input**
    This tool compares text-converted FCS files from a data collection to the MFI generated by a FLOCK run. The same data collection merged and run with FLOCK should be used to ensure consistency in the attribution of events to populations.

    **Output**
    Each event within each file of a dataset collection is attributed to a population depending on its intensity profile.
    A table of the population composition of each file is generated as well as MFI and population descriptive statistics.
