    **Input**
    Input files are tab-separated files containing counts of events in each population for each file compared to reference population patterns, MFI for each marker in each population for each file, and individual files used in the comparison. The output from a Cross Sample analysis as well as from mapping individual files to a FlowSOM reference tree are suitable files.
    The Centroids file can be generated with the following Flow Analysis tool:

    - Generate the centroids from a flow result file

    The number of populations or clusters this tool can handle is limited to 40.

    **Output**
    The output is an interactive page that allows visualization of the data.
