description: This tool uses MetaCyto to cluster events automatically from several sets of FCS files.

    **Input**
    This tool requires the pre-processing summary generated for MetaCyto as well as the pre-processed FCS files.

    Parameters
    Quantile threshold
    This value represents the minimum proportion of events in a cluster that should express more (or less) than the cutoff value for a given marker. With a value of 0.8, a cluster will be labeled Marker1+ if over 80% of cells in the cluster express Marker1 at a higher level than a cutoff value determined by the clustering analysis.
    Minimum Number of events
    This value represents the minimum proportion of cells in each region after bisection. Keep this factor small to avoid bisecting uni-mode distributions.
    Markers to exclude
    Please provide a comma-separated list of the markers that should be excluded from the clustering analysis. By default, FSC, SSC, Time and Cell Length channels are excluded, but providing a list of markers overrides the default settings.
    Additional cluster definitions
    Please provide additional gate definitions as comma-separated lists of marker names, for instance "CD3+, CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+".
    FlowSOM - Number of meta-clusters
    Please indicate the exact number of meta-clusters expected.
    FlowSOM - Grid dimension
    Please indicate the dimension of the grid for establishing the SOM. The dimension of the grid defines the number of clusters (height x width = cluster)
    FlowSOM - Seed
    Please indicate a random number to use as seed. To make your analysis reproducible, use the same seed.

    **Output**
    This tool generates a list of clusters identified, including optionally provided cluster definitions, as well as a table of the MFI for each marker in each cluster in each file, and proportion of each cluster in each file. A list of unused cluster definitions, if any, is also generated.
