    **Input**
    This tool requires the pre-processing summary generated for MetaCyto as well as the pre-processed FCS files.
    Cluster definitions
    Please provide gate definitions as comma-separated lists of marker names, for instance "CD3+, CD4+, CD25+, Foxp3+".
    **Output file**
    This tool generates a list of provided clusters definitions, as well as a table of the MFI for each marker in each cluster in each file, and proportion of each cluster in each file. A list of unused cluster definitions, if any, is also generated.
