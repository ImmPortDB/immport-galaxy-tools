description: This tool uses MetaCyto's preprocessing function to prepare sets of FCS files for a MetaCyto analysis.

    **Input**
    This tool requires one or more sets of FCS files.
      The number provided for sub-sampling corresponds to the number of events randomly sampled from each FCS files.

    **Output file**
    This tool generates one or more FCS files containing optionally sub-sampled data from the input FCS data sets. The FCS data can optionally be compensated and/or transformed. A summary of the operations is also generated.
    This tool uses the arcsinh transformation. If you would like to use another transformation algorithm, sets of files can be prepared independantly by using the following tools:
      Merge and downsample FCS files with FlowSOM
      Transform FCS data with optional compensation and automated gating with flowDensity.
    The workflow to use MetaCyto in R vs. ImmPort Galaxy are slightly different - please use the following tool in FCS File Tools to harmonize FCS files before MetaCyto pre-processing:
      Edit markers or channels in FCS files
